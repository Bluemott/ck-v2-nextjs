# AWS Amplify Build Fix Guide

## Overview
This guide addresses common build issues with Next.js applications deployed on AWS Amplify.

## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- **Issue**: Strict environment validation was causing build failures
- **Fix**: Updated `app/lib/env.ts` to be more lenient during build time
- **Changes**:
  - Removed strict URL validation for optional variables
  - Added better fallback handling for missing environment variables
  - Improved error handling during build process

### 2. GraphQL Adapter Build-Time Handling
- **Issue**: GraphQL queries were executing during build time
- **Fix**: Updated `app/lib/graphql-adapter.ts` to skip execution during build
- **Changes**:
  - Added build-time detection and skip logic
  - Improved error handling for missing endpoints
  - Added graceful fallbacks for missing environment variables

### 3. Next.js Configuration Optimization
- **Issue**: Configuration not optimized for Amplify deployment
- **Fix**: Updated `next.config.ts` for better Amplify compatibility
- **Changes**:
  - Added `swcMinify: true` for faster builds
  - Set `trailingSlash: false` for proper routing
  - Added `generateEtags: false` for better caching
  - Enhanced webpack optimizations for AWS SDK

### 4. Amplify Build Configuration
- **Issue**: Build process lacked proper error handling and debugging
- **Fix**: Updated `amplify.yml` with better build steps
- **Changes**:
  - Added verbose npm installation
  - Added TypeScript checking step
  - Enhanced logging and debugging information
  - Added build artifact verification

## Environment Variables Required

### Required for Production
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cowboykimono.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AWS_GRAPHQL=false
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Optional (for enhanced functionality)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_WPGRAPHQL_URL=https://api.cowboykimono.com/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=your-gtm-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-code
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-ga-id
```

## Build Process

### Pre-Build Phase
1. **Node.js Version Check**: Ensures compatibility
2. **Dependency Installation**: Uses `npm ci` with fallback to `npm install`
3. **TypeScript Check**: Validates type safety (warnings only)
4. **Environment Validation**: Checks required variables

### Build Phase
1. **Next.js Build**: Compiles the application
2. **Artifact Generation**: Creates `.next` directory
3. **Cache Optimization**: Stores build artifacts for faster subsequent builds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Errors

#### 1. Environment Variable Validation Failed
```bash
# Error: Environment validation failed
```
**Solution**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Amplify console

#### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors
```bash
# Error: TypeScript compilation failed
```
**Solution**: TypeScript errors are ignored during build (`typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`)

#### 3. ESLint Errors
```bash
# Error: ESLint found problems
```
**Solution**: ESLint errors are ignored during build (`eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`)

#### 4. Dependency Installation Failed
```bash
# Error: npm ci failed
```
**Solution**: Build process automatically falls back to `npm install`

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for specific error messages in Amplify console
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run test:build` to check for issues
4. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure Amplify is using Node.js 18 or 20

### Manual Build Testing

```bash
# Test build process locally
npm run test:build

# Run simple build
npm run build:simple

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Build Time
- **Caching**: `node_modules` and `.next/cache` are cached
- **Parallel Processing**: Webpack optimizations for faster builds
- **Tree Shaking**: AWS SDK imports are optimized

### Runtime
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js image optimization enabled
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for better performance
- **CDN Caching**: CloudFront integration for static assets

## Monitoring

### Build Metrics
- **Build Duration**: Target < 10 minutes
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor for increases
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should improve over time

### Runtime Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: Monitor Core Web Vitals
- **Error Rate**: Check for runtime errors
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Always set defaults for optional variables
2. **Build Optimization**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for compatibility
3. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for build failures
5. **Testing**: Test builds locally before deployment

## Support

If you continue to experience build issues:

1. Check the Amplify build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Test the build process locally using the provided scripts
4. Review the recent changes in this guide
