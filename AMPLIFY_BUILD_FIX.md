# Amplify Build Fix Guide

## Current Issue Analysis

The build is failing at the very first command (`node --version`) in the preBuild phase, which suggests:

1. **Node.js Environment Issue**: Node.js may not be properly configured in the Amplify build environment
2. **PATH Issues**: The build environment may not have Node.js in the PATH
3. **Permission Issues**: Similar to the local Windows permission error you encountered

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced amplify.yml (Current)
- Added comprehensive environment diagnostics
- Multiple fallback paths for Node.js detection
- Better error handling with `|| echo` fallbacks
- Detailed logging to identify the exact issue

### 2. Fallback Configuration (amplify-fallback.yml)
- Explicit PATH setup
- Alternative Node.js location checks
- More robust error handling

### 3. Updated Local Build Script
- Better Windows permission handling
- Improved error recovery
- More detailed logging

## Immediate Actions

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Configuration (Current)
The current `amplify.yml` will provide detailed diagnostics about what's failing.

### Option 2: Try Fallback Configuration
```bash
# Backup current config
mv amplify.yml amplify.yml.current
# Use fallback config
mv amplify-fallback.yml amplify.yml
# Push to dev branch
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the updated local build script
npm run build:simple
```

## Expected Build Output

With the enhanced configuration, you should see detailed output like:
```
Starting preBuild phase
Node not found in PATH
Current directory: /codebuild/output/...
Directory contents: [file listing]
Environment variables: [PATH info]
Trying to find Node.js...
Node not found in /usr
Node not available at /usr/bin/node
```

This will help us identify exactly where Node.js is located in the Amplify environment.

## Common Amplify Environment Issues

1. **Node.js Version**: Amplify may be using a different Node.js version than expected
2. **PATH Configuration**: Node.js may be installed but not in PATH
3. **Permission Issues**: Similar to your local Windows issue
4. **Workspace Conflicts**: The workspace setup may be causing environment issues

## Next Steps

1. **Push the enhanced configuration** to get detailed diagnostics
2. **Monitor the build logs** for the specific error messages
3. **Based on the output**, we can determine the exact issue
4. **Apply the appropriate fix** based on the diagnostics

## Alternative Solutions

If the enhanced configuration doesn't work:

1. **Use the fallback configuration** (`amplify-fallback.yml`)
2. **Remove workspace dependencies** temporarily
3. **Use a different Node.js version** in Amplify settings
4. **Contact AWS Support** if it's an Amplify environment issue

## Rollback Plan

If needed, you can always:
1. Restore the original `amplify.yml.backup`
2. Try the fallback configuration
3. Remove workspace dependencies temporarily
