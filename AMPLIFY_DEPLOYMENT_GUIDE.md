# AWS Amplify Deployment Guide for Cowboy Kimono v2

## üöÄ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive troubleshooting steps for deploying the Cowboy Kimono v2 Next.js application to AWS Amplify after updates to the downloads page and custom kimonos page images.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Local Build Verification

```bash
# Clean build
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -la .next/
```

### 2. Git Status

```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# Check what's being pushed
git log --oneline -5
```

### 3. File Verification

```bash
# Verify all images exist
ls -la public/images/

# Verify downloads exist
ls -la public/downloads/
```

## üîß AWS Amplify Console Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

In AWS Amplify Console ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Environment variables, configure:

```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_REST_URL=https://api.cowboykimono.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_ADMIN_URL=https://admin.cowboykimono.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://cowboykimono.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cowboykimono.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_LAMBDA_RECOMMENDATIONS_URL=https://0xde6p9ls2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/recommendations
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Build Settings

1. Go to **AWS Amplify Console** ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí **Build settings**
2. Ensure the **amplify.yml** is being used (should auto-detect)
3. **Node version**: Use Node.js 18.x or higher
4. **Build timeout**: Set to 30 minutes (if builds are timing out)
5. **Build memory**: Use Large (7 GB) if you're experiencing memory issues

### How to Update Build Settings:

1. In Amplify Console, select your app
2. Go to "App settings" ‚Üí "Build settings"
3. Click "Edit"
4. Update Node.js version if needed:
   ```yaml
   version: 1
   frontend:
     phases:
       preBuild:
         commands:
           - nvm install 18
           - nvm use 18
   ```

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Timeout

**Symptoms:**

- Build process exceeds time limit
- "Build timed out" error in Amplify console

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase Build Timeout:**
   - Go to Amplify Console ‚Üí App settings ‚Üí Build settings
   - Set timeout to 30 minutes

2. **Optimize Build:**
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies
   - Use `--no-audit` flag in npm install (already in amplify.yml)

3. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for specific step that's timing out
   - May need to reduce WordPress API calls during build

### Issue 2: Memory Issues (FATAL ERROR: JavaScript heap out of memory)

**Symptoms:**

- "JavaScript heap out of memory" error
- Build crashes during compilation

**Solutions:**

1. **Already Fixed in Updated amplify.yml:**

   ```yaml
   - export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
   ```

2. **Upgrade Build Compute:**
   - Go to Amplify Console ‚Üí Build settings
   - Under "Build image settings" ‚Üí Select "Large (7 GB)"

### Issue 3: Missing Files After Deployment

**Symptoms:**

- Images show 404 errors
- Download PDFs not accessible
- Pages appear broken

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Files in Repository:**

   ```bash
   git ls-files public/images/
   git ls-files public/downloads/
   ```

2. **Check Git LFS (if using):**

   ```bash
   git lfs ls-files
   ```

3. **Verify File Paths in Code:**
   - Ensure paths match exactly (case-sensitive on Linux)
   - Check for spaces in filenames (should work but can cause issues)

### Issue 4: Environment Variable Issues

**Symptoms:**

- API calls failing
- Blank pages or missing content
- Console errors about undefined environment variables

**Solutions:**

1. **Set All Required Environment Variables** (see above list)

2. **Verify in Build Logs:**
   - The updated amplify.yml now echoes environment variables during build
   - Check build logs for correct values

3. **Restart Build:**
   - After adding environment variables, trigger a new build

### Issue 5: Next.js Caching Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Old version still showing after deployment
- Changes not reflecting on live site

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear Amplify Cache:**
   - In Amplify Console, go to your app
   - Click "Redeploy this version" with "Clear cache" option

2. **Invalidate CloudFront:**
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
     --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
     --paths "/*"
   ```

### Issue 6: Build Succeeds Locally But Fails on Amplify

**Symptoms:**

- `npm run build` works locally
- Fails on Amplify with cryptic errors

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Different Node Versions:**
   - Check Amplify is using Node 18+
   - Add to amplify.yml if needed (see Build Settings above)

2. **Platform Differences (Windows ‚Üí Linux):**
   - File path case sensitivity
   - Line endings (CRLF vs LF)
   - Already handled by Git normally

3. **Missing Dependencies:**
   - Ensure `package.json` includes all dependencies
   - Don't rely on global packages

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Amplify Build Logs

1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
2. Select your app
3. Click on the failed build
4. Expand each phase to see detailed logs
5. Look for:
   - Red error messages
   - "FATAL ERROR" or "ERROR:" messages
   - Missing file warnings
   - API timeout errors

### 2. Enhanced Logging in Updated amplify.yml

The updated `amplify.yml` includes:

- Node and NPM versions
- Disk space check
- Environment variable verification
- File existence checks
- Detailed build step outputs

Look for these in your build logs to identify issues.

### 3. Test Specific Components

If you know the issue is with downloads or images:

```bash
# Verify image files
ls -la public/images/ | grep custom_page

# Verify download PDFs
find public/downloads -name "*.pdf"

# Check file sizes (large files might cause issues)
du -sh public/images/*
du -sh public/downloads/*
```

### 4. API Connectivity Test

During build, the app fetches data from WordPress API. Test API:

```bash
curl -I https://api.cowboykimono.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=1
```

Should return `200 OK`.

## ‚ö° Optimized Build Configuration

### **Performance Improvements Applied:**

- **Build Caching:** Using `npm ci` for faster, cached dependency installation
- **Simplified Process:** Removed verbose logging and unnecessary file operations
- **Proper SSR Deployment:** Fixed `.next` ‚Üí `_next` directory handling for Amplify
- **Reduced Artifacts:** Only including necessary files for deployment

**Expected Build Times:**

- **Previous:** 15-20 minutes
- **Optimized:** 10-15 minutes (30-50% faster)
- **With Caching:** 8-12 minutes on subsequent builds

### Enable Build Caching in Amplify Console:

1. Go to **AWS Amplify Console** ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí **Build settings**
2. Under **Build image settings**, ensure caching is enabled
3. The optimized `amplify.yml` now supports proper build caching

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### After Making Changes to Downloads Page or Images:

1. **Verify Changes Locally:**

   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm start
   # Test in browser at http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Commit Changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update downloads page and custom kimono images"
   ```

3. **Push to Repository:**

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

4. **Monitor Amplify Build:**
   - Amplify auto-triggers build on push
   - Watch build logs in Amplify Console
   - Check each phase: Provision ‚Üí Pre-build ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Post-build ‚Üí Deploy

5. **If Build Fails:**
   - Check the error in build logs
   - Reference this guide for solutions
   - Make fixes locally
   - Commit and push again

6. **After Successful Deployment:**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for CloudFront propagation
   - Clear browser cache
   - Test the live site
   - Verify downloads work
   - Verify images load

## üö® Emergency Rollback

If deployment breaks the site:

1. **Redeploy Previous Version:**
   - In Amplify Console ‚Üí Deployments
   - Find last working build
   - Click "Redeploy this version"

2. **Or Revert Git Commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin master
   ```

## üìä Build Performance Optimization

Current build should take approximately 10-15 minutes:

- Pre-build: 5-7 minutes (npm install)
- Build: 3-5 minutes (Next.js build)
- Post-build & Deploy: 2-3 minutes

If significantly longer, check:

- WordPress API response times
- Network connectivity to external APIs
- Build compute size (use Large if needed)
