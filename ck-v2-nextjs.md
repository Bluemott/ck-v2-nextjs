**Solution:** 
- Enhanced scoring algorithm with 6 comprehensive strategies
- Added fallback mechanisms to ensure content is always available
- Improved inclusivity with lowered similarity thresholds
- Added author-based recommendations and emergency fallbacks

**Algorithm Strategies (in priority order):**
1. **Exact tag matches** - 12 points per matching tag

3. **Content similarity analysis** - Up to 25 points (lowered threshold to 5%)
4. **Partial tag matches** - 4 points per similar tag
5. **Recent posts** - 2 points (ensures all content gets recommended)

**Note:** Same author scoring was removed as all content has the same author, providing no differentiation.

**Fallback Features:**
- Automatic fallback to recent posts when insufficient matches found
- Emergency fallback system for error conditions
