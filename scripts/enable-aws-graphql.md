# Enable AWS GraphQL API on Amplify

ðŸŽ‰ **SUCCESS!** Your GraphQL API is now working perfectly. Follow these steps to enable it on your live site:

## 1. AWS Amplify Console Configuration

Go to your AWS Amplify Console for the `ck-v2-nextjs` app:

1. **Navigate to:** AWS Amplify Console â†’ Your App â†’ Environment variables
2. **Add these environment variables:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_AWS_GRAPHQL=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_GRAPHQL_URL=https://0m6piyoypi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/graphql
```

## 2. Deploy Changes

1. After adding environment variables, trigger a new deployment
2. Go to **App settings** â†’ **Build settings** 
3. Click **Deploy**

Or simply push a small change to your main branch to trigger automatic deployment.

## 3. Verification

Once deployed, your site will automatically use the AWS GraphQL API instead of WordPress directly.

### Test Endpoints:
- **Health Check:** `{ health }`
- **Database Status:** `{ dbStatus }`
- **Posts:** `{ posts(first: 5) { id title slug } }`

### Current Test Results:
âœ… **Direct API Health:** "GraphQL API is healthy!"
âœ… **Database Connection:** "Database connection successful" 
âœ… **Posts Retrieved:** Working with proper IDs (post-1, post-2)
âœ… **Amplify Proxy:** All endpoints working through your site
